# SOLID Design Principles

## SRP - Single Responsibility Principle
* A principle that states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, which it should encapsulate.
* A class should have only one reason to change (when writing Java code, we will apply this to classes)
* E.g. do not mix the business logic of a class and logic related with persistence of the objects

OPEN - CLOSED Principle
* Modules, classes, and functions should be open for extension but closed for modifications.
* For this reason, best practice is to try to keep modules unchanged once finished and to add new functionality by extending them using inheritance and polymorphism.
